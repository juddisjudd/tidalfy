## üìñ How It Works

1. **Connect Accounts** - Authenticate with both Spotify and Tidal using OAuth
2. **Select Playlist** - Choose any of your Spotify playlists to rebuild
3. **Smart Matching** - The app searches Tidal for each track using multiple strategies:
   - Artist + Track name
   - Track name + Artist
   - Track name only (fallback)
4. **Create & Populate** - Creates a new playlist on Tidal and adds all found tracks
5. **Review Results** - See detailed statistics about the rebuild process

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **No Data Storage** - Your music data is never stored on our servers
- **Secure Authentication** - Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- **Local Token Storage** - Authentication tokens are stored locally in your browser

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- **Development Mode**: Currently in Spotify Development Mode (limited to 25 users)
